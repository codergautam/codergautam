### Hi, I'm Gautam.

I began coding in 2014, mostly in Scratch. I was always interested in computers as a child, and currently I do JS, Python, some Java, and everything else that is thrown at me. When I am not working, I use my leisure time to spend time with friends, create and edit content, and extend my knowledge on programming.
